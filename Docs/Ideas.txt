Potentiometer to vary brightness
Potentiometer to vary flashing speed
Vary flashing duty cycle?
Water proof case
Battery life indicator (probably requires too much power... 
	Although if using a microcontroller, could PWM a code to the LED to indicate)
Sounds?
Different battery options?
rechargeable?

Make the housing fit on a keychain!

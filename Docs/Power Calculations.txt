Power Calculations:

Consumption while asleep: 34.66 uA at nominal battery voltage of 6 V. 
4.76 mA at low
7.4 mA at medium
12.7 mA at high
4 - 13 mA at flashing

Battery Options:
----------------
--> CR2032 has dimensions of 20mm diameter by 3.2mm height, 235 mAh capacity
    I can stack two of these inside the holder to avoid sagging below 3.3V
--> CR2477 has dimensions of 24.5mm diameter by  7.7mm height, 1Ah capacity, 
    but sagging over time will decrease below 3.3V + dropout of the regulator, 
    so I can't use this battery
--> CR2430 has dimensions of 24.5mm diameter by 3.0mm height, 320 mAh capacity
    I can stack two of these as well, and they fill the whole space better than
    the CR2302

Theoretical battery life when using two CR2430 batteries in series:
Asleep: 9232.5 hours = 384.7 days
Low:    67.2   hours = 2.8   days
Medium 	43.2   hours = 1.8   days
High	25.2   hours = 1.05  days
Flash	37.6   hours = 1.57  days
(assuming average of 4 and 13 mA)

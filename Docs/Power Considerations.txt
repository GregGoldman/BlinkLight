Power Calculations:

consumption while asleep:

Battery capacity with CR2032: 235 mAh

CR2032 has dimensions of 20mm diameter by 3.2mm height, 235 mAh capacity

CR2477 has dimensions of 24.5mm diameter by  7.7mm height, 1Ah capacity

Two stacked CR2032 batteries fit perfectly inside the case with the programming pins attached

Thus, the final two batteries chosen should not exceed a height of 3.2mm each to ensure a good fit, assuming the case stays the same size. 


Battery capacity with CR2430 is 320 mAh! and it fits!
